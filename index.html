    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Memory Zone Jr. exists to help kids ages 7–13 build confidence through
      simple, focused games that strengthen memory, attention, and problem-solving.

  <section id="about" class="section section-alt">
    <h2>What Is Memory Zone Jr.?</h2>
    <p>
      Memory Zone Jr. is a learning world designed for kids ages 7–13 who benefit
      from short, structured activities that build memory, focus, and confidence.
      Through playful mini-games and clear visuals, learners can practice skills
      without feeling overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to create tools the creator wished existed growing up — supportive,
      welcoming spaces where students with ADHD, dyslexia, other learning differences,
      or reading struggles can enjoy learning and feel capable every step of the way.
